TESTING INSTRUCTIONS

1. Start the frontend with yarn start
2. Start the backend in IDE, running the main method to initialize Spring
3. Test runner: jUnit 4 (right click on the test, run as JUnit Test) 
(If an error message shows up saying it's not possible to test it using JUnit 5, right click on the test again, Run As-> Run Configurations -> 
and choose Test runner: JUnit 4 from the dropdown list.)

The table needs to be empty for every test to run successfully (Spring boot needs to be restarted).
